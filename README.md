## Project Overview

**Show2Night** is an online platform designed for browsing a wide range of movies and TV series, catering to all tastes and preferences. From action-packed films to heartwarming dramas, Show2Night makes it easy for users to search, filter, and find content. The system provides premium features such as movie purchases for premium members, along with subscription options. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles, while administrators handle user account management and content updates.

### Key Features
